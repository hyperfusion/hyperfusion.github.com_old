		<h2>about me</h2>
		<p>I'm Jonathan Ho. I'm a high school student in California. I've been tinkering with computer programming since early in elementary school, and over the years I've created countless small projects and toys.</p>
		<p>I could have never learned programming had it not been for open-source software&mdash;I've learned countless coding techniques from reading source code, and I rely almost entirely on an open-source programming environment. So in the giving spirit of open source, I've decided to post some of my most interesting projects here on GitHub. Everything's under the MIT/X11 license, so there's nothing to worry about if you decide to use my horrible code for any reason.</p>
		<p>So, below are short descriptions of my projects. To the right is a navigation bar that contains links to the GitHub repository pages of the projects.</p>

		<h2>H1N1</h2>
		<p>H1N1 is a small, bare-bones Scheme interpreter that I wrote to help me learn about interpreters and compilers. It's written in pure Java and relies on no external dependencies. Here's a more formal description of the project:</p>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>H1N1 a small Scheme interpreter, intended for students or programmers. It should fully support anonymous functions, basic control structures, and simple I/O operations. There should also be a small standard library of math functions and utility features.</p>
		<p>The interpreter should sacrifice speed and efficiency of execution for clarity and simplicity of implementation.</p>
		<p>There are numerous Scheme interpreters currently available, such as <span class="caps">PLT</span> Scheme, GNU Guile, and Gambit. This project does not aim to compete with these existing interpreters; it does not even attempt to fully implement the R5RS or R6RS standard. Rather, it aims to serve as a simple, clear sample implementation suitable for pedagogical purposes. It should be easily extendable by any interested party.</p>
		<h3>Detailed Objectives</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Basic operations &#8211; should support all basic arithmetic operations (+ , -, *, /, %). Should restrict types to floating-point for simplicity. Should also support boolean logic (and, or, etc.) and basic string manipulation (concatenation).</li>
			<li>Anonymous functions &#8211; should support first-class anonymous functions with the lambda keyword.</li>
			<li>Partial function application &#8211; when functions are applied with insufficient arguments, they are automatically partially applied. A wrapper function is returned.</li>
			<li>Control structures &#8211; if, cond, let</li>
			<li>Basic I/O &#8211; basic I/O procedures (print, write) should be supported for easy user interaction</li>
			<li>Standard library &#8211; the standard library should support standard functional programming idioms (map, fold, filter, etc.), and should provide math procedures (sin, cos, tan, log, etc.).</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Limitations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>For simplicity, this interpreter will perform no pre-execution passes on the syntax tree. Therefore, no optimization can be done, and no error warnings can be raised until the tree is actually evaluated.</li>
			<li>Improper lists will not be implemented.</li>
			<li>There will be no support for macros.</li>
		</ul>	
		<h3>Design outline</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>A tokenizer class is responsible for tokenizing an input string according to Scheme syntax rules.</li>
			<li>A parser class reads a stream of tokens and constructs a syntax tree. The syntax tree is a hierarchy of expression classes, which all derive from the abstract Expr class. All Expr classes come with toString() methods for easy printing, equals() methods, and may or may not provide hashCode() methods.</li>
			<li>A VM (virtual machine) class is responsible for evaluating an expression, and keeps track of local variables in a stack. Built-in functionality is separated into the static Builtin class, which operates on a given virtual machine (this is done to separate the functionality of built-in procedures from the logic of the virtual machine).</li>
			<li>A main class is responsible for reading input from the user, passing it from the tokenizer to the parser and to the virtual machine, and printing the value to output for the user to see.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Current status</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The current H1N1 implements the if control structure, list manipulation methods, arithmetic and boolean operators, multiple levels of equality testing (reference-level and value-level), anonymous functions, partial function application, and syntactic sugar for list quoting.</li>
			<li>User interaction is performed through a read-eval-print loop (a <span class="caps">REPL</span>). The interpreter can also execute code from an input file.</li>
			<li>Many control structures are still lacking, and I/O operations and a standard library are yet to be implemented.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>asdftris</h2>
		<p>All programmers need to write a Tetris clone as a rite of passage, and asdftris is mine. It's written in Python, and uses the excellent <a href="http://www.pygame.org/">PyGame</a> SDL bindings for graphics and input.</p>
		<p>Here's a quick screenshot:<img src="asdftris.png" alt="asdftris screenshot" /></p>
